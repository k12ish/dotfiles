# Configuration files are read system-wide from /usr/local/etc/mpv.conf
# and per-user from ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf, where per-user settings override
# system-wide settings, all of which are overridden by the command line.
#
# Configuration file settings and the command line options use the same
# underlying mechanisms. Most options can be put into the configuration file
# by dropping the preceding '--'. See the man page for a complete list of
# options.
#
# See the CONFIGURATION FILES section in the man page
# for a detailed description of the syntax.

# Start in fullscreen mode by default.
fs=yes


# Do not close the window on exit.
keep-open=yes

# Keep the player window on top of all other windows.
#ontop=yes

# Specify high quality video rendering preset (for --vo=gpu only)
# Can cause performance problems with some drivers and GPUs.
profile=gpu-hq

# Force video to lock on the display's refresh rate, and change video and audio
# speed to some degree to ensure synchronous playback - can cause problems
# with some drivers and desktop environments.
#video-sync=display-resample

# Enable hardware decoding if available. Often, this does not work with all
# video outputs, but should work well with default settings on most systems.
# If performance or energy usage is an issue, forcing the vdpau or vaapi VOs
# may or may not help.
hwdec=auto

##################
# audio settings #
##################

# Specify default audio device. You can list devices with: --audio-device=help
# The option takes the device string (the stuff between the '...').
#audio-device=alsa/default

# Do not filter audio to keep pitch when changing playback speed.
#audio-pitch-correction=no

# Output 5.1 audio natively, and upmix/downmix audio with a different format.
#audio-channels=5.1
# Disable any automatic remix, _if_ the audio output accepts the audio format.
# of the currently played file. See caveats mentioned in the manpage.
# (The default is "auto-safe", see manpage.)
#audio-channels=auto

# Enable fuzzy searching:

# Profiles #

# The options declared as part of profiles override global default settings,
# but only take effect when the profile is active.

# The following profile can be enabled on the command line with: --profile=eye-cancer
